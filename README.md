🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Natural Language Understanding** – Understands and interprets user queries accurately.  
- 💬 **Conversational Context** – Maintains context across multiple turns of conversation.  
- 📄 **Document-Based Q&A** – Upload a document (PDF, TXT, etc.) and ask natural questions about its content.  
- 🌐 **Web Integration** – Works with modern frontend frameworks like React or Next.js.  
- ⚡ **FastAPI Backend** – High-performance backend for quick and scalable AI responses.  
- 🔐 **API Integration** – Connects with OpenAI or other LLM APIs for intelligent responses.  
- 📈 **Continuous Learning** – Can be extended to improve with each interaction.  


🧩 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React / Vite / Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python) |
| **AI Engine** | OpenAI GPT / LangChain |
| **Database / Vector Store** | Pinecone / FAISS |
| **Environment** | .env for API keys and configurations |


⚙️ Installation & Setup

 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key


Run the FastAPI server:

uvicorn main:app --reload

3. Set up the frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

🧠 How It Works

The user uploads a document or enters a query.

The backend extracts and vectorizes the text using embeddings.

A query is passed to the LLM (e.g., GPT-4) with relevant context.

The model generates an accurate and contextual response.

The answer is displayed instantly on the frontend.

🧰 Future Improvements

Add voice-based interaction

Support for multiple document types (DOCX, CSV, etc.)

User authentication and session management

Integration with other AI APIs (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
